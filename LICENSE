The GNU General Public License (GPL) by design **requires** modification and redistribution rights — it’s built around freedom to change and share software. If you want a GPL-style license but with **no modification allowed**, you actually need a different type of license, since restricting modification makes it **not GPL-compatible**.

* Allow **use, copy, and distribution only as-is**.
* Explicitly **forbid modification, derivative works, or merging**.
* Require that redistribution (if any) follows your GitHub limits.

Here’s a draft:

Would you like me to **mirror the full GPL layout and section numbering** (like GPL v3 with Definitions, Terms, Termination, etc.) but rewritten with your **no modification rule** — so it looks and reads like a “GPL variant”?
